## Brick Arch

Brick Arch is a tool for QCAD 3 created and developed by
[Christopher Mead](https://mead.one/cv.htm) since 2017 for 
[H.G. Matthews Specialist Brick Services](https://www.hgmatthews.com/specialist-brick-services/).

The aim of this project is to create a suite of tools for automatically drawing
templates for various types of arches, e.g. flat-gauge, radial, semicircular,
and bullseye, with various options for brick dimensions, joint sizes, and number
and orientation of joints.

This repository contains an incomplete version of the current state of BrickArch
licensed as free, libre open source software, intended to give an idea of what
this project is and how I have attempted to achieve it.

This could not have been achieved without the help and guidance I've recieved on
multiple occasions from [andrew](https://qcad.org/rsforum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=2)
from the QCAD forums.
